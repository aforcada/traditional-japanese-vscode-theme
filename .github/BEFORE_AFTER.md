# Before vs After: Release Process Comparison

## 📊 Before Automation (Manual Process)

### Time Required: 15-30 minutes per release

```
Step 1: Update package.json
  ⏱️ 1 min

  📝 Action: Open file, edit version, save

Step 2: Update CHANGELOG.md  
  ⏱️ 2-3 min
  ⚠️ Risk: Forget date, wrong format, typos
  📝 Action: Add entry, format text, check date

Step 3: Commit changes
