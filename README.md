# Traditional Japanese Theme

A curated Visual Studio Code theme pack inspired by classic Japanese palettes. Each variant focuses on a different cultural reference while keeping consistent token semantics for comfortable coding sessions.

## Included Themes

- **Traditional Japanese Wabi Sabi**: Warm ink-washed neutrals, aged gold accents, and moss greens for a calm everyday workspace.
- **Traditional Japanese Momiji**: Autumn koyo oranges and sunlit wood tones that evoke mountain foliage.
- **Traditional Japanese Sakura**: Plum dusk backdrops with sakura pink highlights and jade greens.
- **Traditional Japanese Fuji**: Snow-tipped indigo blues with alpine turquoise accents.
- **Traditional Japanese Torii**: Vermilion shrine reds balanced by temple gold and forest greens.

Wabi Sabi loads by default when the extension is activated; switch to any other variant via `Preferences: Color Theme`.

## Installation
