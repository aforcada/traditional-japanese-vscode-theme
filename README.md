## 🏯 Cultural Inspiration

- **Fuji**: Evokes ruri blues and yuki-shiro whites from Mount Fuji’s snowcap against a cobalt sky, with amber signal lamps guiding the ascent.
- **Sakura**: Echoes cherry blossom nights, mixing petals, twilight violets, and the calming greens of new buds (aoba) under lantern light.
- **Matcha**: Distills the chanoyu ritual—freshly whisked tea, tatami mats, bamboo whisks, and raku ceramics—into moss greens, toasted arroz browns, and paper-soft creams.
- **Momiji**: Draws on late-autumn maple foliage (momiji) and lacquerware ember tones, balanced with kinpaku-inspired gilded highlights.
- **Torii**: Celebrates vermilion shrine gates coated in bengara pigment, contrasted by aged bronze bells and evergreen shrine gardens.
- **Wabi Sabi**: Channels rustic tea bowls and weathered timber, pairing sumi ink darkness with burnished kincha gold for calm imperfection.
